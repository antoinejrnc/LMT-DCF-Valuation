## 🛠 Methodology

### 1. Historical Financial Analysis
- Revenue, EBIT, capex, and cash flow extracted from SEC filings  
- Normalization of margins and capital efficiency metrics

### 2. Forecasting (2025–2029)
Forecast assumptions based on:
- U.S. defense budget trends  
- NATO modernization spending  
- Lockheed Martin’s long-term backlog visibility  
- Historical capex and working capital patterns  

### 3. Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)
FCFF calculated as:  

```text
FCFF = EBIT * (1 – Tax Rate)
       – Capex
       – ΔWorking Capital
